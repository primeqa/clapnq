The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol. This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water, which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules, causes the water to foam, ultimately generating the `` jet '' or eruption like nature of the effusion.

-7500001945758100313	how water is carried by the transpiration stream	848049723_1859-3442	The water passes from the soil to the root by osmosis.  As the cell's surface membrane of the root hair cell is semi-permeable, osmosis can take place; and water passes from the soil to the root hairs. The next stage in the transpiration stream is water passing into the xylem vessels. The water either goes through the cortex cells or bypasses them -- going through their cell walls.  After this, the water moves up the xylem vessels to the leaves through diffusion: A pressure change between the top and bottom of the vessel.   The last stage in the transpiration stream is the water moving into the leaves, and then the actual transpiration.  First, the water moves into the mesophyll cells from the top of the xylem vessels, then the water evaporates out of the cells into the spaces between the cells in the leaf.

964501917789793709	why do your eyes get red in pictures	805966162_956-2945	In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close, so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil, reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil.  The camera records this reflected light. The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina.   The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region, and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect. The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina.   Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes.

5739443045617036105	rhyme scheme of the poem ode on a grecian urn	799712577_6700-7960	"""Ode on a Grecian Urn"" is organized into ten-line stanzas, beginning with an ABAB rhyme scheme and ending with a Miltonic sestet (1st and 5th stanzas CDEDCE, 2nd stanza CDECED, and 3rd and 4th stanzas CDECDE). While ode-writers from antiquity adhered to rigid patterns of strophe, antistrophe, and epode, the form by Keats's time had undergone enough transformation that it represented a manner rather than a set method for writing a certain type of lyric poetry.  Keats's odes seek to find a ""classical balance"" between two extremes, and in the structure of ""Ode on a Grecian Urn"", these extremes are the symmetrical structure of classical literature and the asymmetry of Romantic poetry. The use of the ABAB structure in the beginning lines of each stanza represents a clear example of structure found in classical literature, and the remaining six lines appear to break free of the traditional poetic styles of Greek and Roman odes.::Ode on a Grecian Urn is organized into ten - line stanzas , beginning with an ABAB rhyme scheme and ending with a Miltonic sestet ( 1st and 5th stanzas CDEDCE , 2nd stanza CDECED , and 3rd and 4th stanzas CDECDE ) .

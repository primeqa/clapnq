Joshua went to him , and said to him , `` Are you for us , or for our adversaries ? '' `` . The Synoptic Gospels attribute the following quote to Jesus : `` Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters '' ( Matthew 12 : 30 ) , as well as its contrapositive , `` Whoever is not against us is for us '' ( Luke 9 : 50 ; Mark 9 : 40 ) . Marcus Tullius Cicero , in an oration before Julius Caesar in 46 BCE , published as Pro Ligario , made the following distinction : `` For we heard you say that we looked upon all as enemies that were not with us ; but that you looked upon all as friends that were not against you . '' Vladimir Ilyich Lenin , in a speech discussing the Chief Committee for Political Education , told the assembled delegates that `` It is with absolute frankness that we speak of this struggle of the proletariat ; each man must choose between joining our side or the other side . Any attempt to avoid taking sides in this issue must end in fiasco . '' George Orwell wrote in his 1942 essay `` Pacifism and the War '' , `` If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other . Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one . In practice , ' he that is not with me is against me ' . The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle , while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you , is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security .

J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r , in an effort to unite Hungary after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 , announced in December 1961 , `` those who are not against us are with us . '' Common form of Cold War terminology . On 30 September 1970 , the Milwaukee Journal quoted a police official of the Greek military junta of 1967 -- 74 as saying to his political prisoners : `` You make yourself ridiculous ( sic ) by thinking you can do anything . The word is divided in two . The Russians and the Americans , no one else . What are we ? Americans . Behind me there is the government , behind the government is NATO , behind NATO is the US . You ca n't fight us , we are Americans . '' Hillary Clinton said on September 13 , 2001 : `` Every nation has to either be with us , or against us . Those who harbor terrorists , or who finance them , are going to pay a price . '' President George W. Bush , in an address to a joint session of Congress on September 20 , 2001 said , `` Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make .

He fought for Aerys II during Robert 's Rebellion and was sent to the Wall as punishment . He is a bitter , cruel , fanatical and hardened man but knows firsthand what it is like to serve in the Night 's Watch during the winter . The previous winter , he was caught north of the Wall on a ranging mission and he and the other members of his party were forced to eat the rangers who died in order to survive . Thorne returns in Season 4 , now the acting Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch following the death of Jeor Mormont , and becomes friends with Janos Slynt . He advocates Jon 's execution for his actions in season 3 , but Jon is exonerated by Maester Aemon . Thorne later notices that the people like Jon better than him , and will most likely elect Jon as the new Lord Commander , which would make him Thorne 's superior . To avoid this , Thorne , on Slynt 's suggestion , allows Jon to lead a mission to kill the Night 's Watch mutineers in the hopes that Jon will be killed in battle , though Jon survives . Out of spite , Thorne refuses Jon 's proposal to seal off Castle Black to stop the wildlings from breaching . When the wildling army arrives , Alliser grudgingly admits to Jon that he should have listened to him , but valiantly leads his men into battle . Alliser personally duels Tormund Giantsbane , but is wounded . He is last seen being taken inside Castle Black for treatment while yelling for his men to continue fighting . In season 5 , he has been healed but walks with a limp . He appears to be the leading contender for being voted the new official Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch . Though he ultimately loses to Jon Snow by one vote in a three - way race , he is named First Ranger by Jon , which he appears to appreciate . When Jon sentences Slynt to execution for insubordination , Thorne briefly blocks Eddison Tollett 's way , but quickly abandons Slynt to his fate . After Jon 's return from Hardhome , he eventually opens the gate for the incoming wildling refugees , showing deep resentment for the new Lord Commander 's ambition to forge an alliance with the wildling tribes . After Davos ' return to the Wall , Alliser dispatches Olly with word of Benjen Stark 's current state ; the ploy is soon uncovered as a mutiny , wherein a disarmed Jon is trapped and stabbed to death . Alliser delivers the first blow , under the call `` For the Watch ! '' and leaves the Lord Commander dying in the snow .

That said , while consideration must be of sufficient value in the law 's eyes , it need not reflect an adequate price . Proverbially , one may sell a house for as little as a peppercorn , even if the seller `` does not like pepper and will throw away the corn . '' This means the courts do not generally enquire into the fairness of the exchange , unless there is statutory regulation or ( in specific contexts such as for consumers , employment , or tenancies ) there are two parties of unequal bargaining power . Another difficulty is that consideration for a deal was said not to exist if the thing given was an act done before the promise , such as promising to pay off a loan for money already used to educate a girl . In this situation the courts have long shown themselves willing to hold that the thing done was implicitly relying on the expectation of a reward . More significant problems arise where parties to a contract wish to vary its terms . The old rule , predating the development of the protections in the law of economic duress , was that if one side merely promises to perform a duty which she had already undertaken in return for a higher price , there is no contract . However , in the leading case of Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls ( Contractors ) Ltd , the Court of Appeal held that it would be more ready to construe someone performing essentially what they were bound to do before as giving consideration for the new deal if they conferred a `` practical benefit '' on the other side . So , when Williams , a carpenter , was promised by Roffey Bros , the builders , more money to complete work on time , it was held that because Roffey Bros would avoid having to pay a penalty clause for late completion of its own contract , would potentially avoid the expense of litigation and had a slightly more sensible mechanism for payments , these were enough . Speaking of consideration , Russell LJ stated that , `` courts nowadays should be more ready to find its existence ... where the bargaining powers are not unequal and where the finding of consideration reflects the true intention of the parties . '' In other words , in the context of contractual variations , the definition of consideration has been watered down . However , in one situation the `` practical benefit '' analysis can not be invoked , namely where the agreed variation is to reduce debt repayments . In Foakes v Beer , the House of Lords held that even though Mrs Beer promised Mr Foakes he could pay back \u00a3 2090 19 s by instalment and without interest , she could subsequently change her mind and demand the whole sum . Despite Lord Blackburn registering a note of dissent in that case and other doubts , the Court of Appeal held in Re Selectmove Ltd , that it was bound by the precedent of the Lords and could not deploy the `` practical benefit '' reasoning of Williams for any debt repayment cases .","sentences":["When a contract is formed , good consideration is needed , and so a gratuitous promise is not binding .","That said , while consideration must be of sufficient value in the law 's eyes , it need not reflect an adequate price .","Proverbially , one may sell a house for as little as a peppercorn , even if the seller `` does not like pepper and will throw away the corn .

Examples include Queen Elizabeth II , the governors - general in Commonwealth realms , or the presidents of many countries , and state or provincial governors in federal systems . Exceptions to this are Ireland and Israel , whose presidents are de jure and de facto ceremonial , and the latter possesses no reserve powers whatsoever . A head of government ( or head of the executive ) , known as the prime minister ( PM ) , premier , or first minister . While the head of state appoints the head of government , constitutional convention suggests that a majority of elected Members of Parliament must support the person appointed . If more than half of elected parliamentarians belong to the same political party , then the parliamentary leader of that party typically is appointed . An exception to this was Israel , in which direct prime - ministerial elections were made in 1996 , 1999 and 2001 . An executive branch led by the head of government usually made up of members of the legislature with the senior members of the executive in a cabinet adhering to the principle of cabinet collective responsibility ; such members execute executive authority on behalf of the nominal or theoretical executive authority . An independent , non-partisan civil service which advises on , and implements , decisions of those ministers . Civil servants hold permanent appointments and can expect merit - based selection processes and continuity of employment when governments change . A parliamentary opposition ( in a multi-party system ) with an official Leader of the Opposition . A legislature , often bicameral , with at least one elected house -- although unicameral systems also exist ; legislative members are usually elected by district in first - past - the - post elections ( as opposed to country - wide proportional representation ) . Exceptions to this include New Zealand , which changed in 1993 to use mixed - member proportional representation ; Israel , which has always used country wide proportional representation ; and Australia , which uses preferential voting . A lower house of parliament with an ability to dismiss a government by `` withholding ( or blocking ) Supply '' ( rejecting a budget ) , passing a motion of no confidence , or defeating a confidence motion . The Westminster system enables a government to be defeated or forced into a general election independently . A parliament which can be dissolved and snap elections called at any time . Parliamentary privilege , which allows the legislature to discuss any issue it deems relevant , without fear of consequences stemming from defamatory statements or records thereof Minutes of meetings , often known as Hansard , including an ability for the legislature to strike discussion from these minutes The ability of courts to address silence or ambiguity in the parliament 's statutory law through the development of common law .

Currently , the Premier League does not have a maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team , but does require at least eight homegrown players . Greg Dyke , new chairman of the Football Association ( FA ) , wants to implement much stronger regulation of foreign players . His intention is clear as stated in an op - ed piece so that England can win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . Some of Dyke 's propositions include : homegrown players in a top - flight 25 - man first - team squad be increased from eight to 12 two of which must be brought up in the teams youth system , and also changing the definition of what it is to be a homegrown player . Currently , to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty - one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years .

In a calculated risk , Riedesel left 500 men to guard the vital supply train and marched off toward the action with the rest of his column . Two of his companies advanced on the double and opened vicious fire on the American right , and Fraser 's force threatened to turn the American left flank . In response to the latter threat , Arnold requested more forces , and Gates allowed him to dispatch Ebenezer Learned 's brigade ( 2nd , 8th and 9th Massachusetts ) .

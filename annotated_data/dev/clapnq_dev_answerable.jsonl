In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System .

Some sources claim he was a Swedish born emigrant from Komstad , Norra Ljunga parish in Sm\u00e5land , Sweden , who arrived in New Netherland during the spring of 1639 . Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named `` Emmanus '' close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in Mott Haven . He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem ( on Manhattan Island ) , and bought additional tracts from the local tribes . He eventually accumulated 500 acres ( 200 ha ) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung , which became known as Bronck 's River or the Bronx ( River ) . Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck 's Land . The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck , either Jonas Bronck 's son or his younger brother . More recent research indicates that Pieter was probably Jonas ' nephew or cousin , but certainly of the same family .

According to the Handbook of Texas website , the former falls were flooded by the lake , which was created by a shelf of limestone running diagonally across the Colorado River from northeast to southwest . The upper layer of limestone , brownish on the exterior but a deep blue inside , was so hard and cherty it was mistaken for marble . The falls were actually three distinct formations at the head of a canyon 1.25 miles ( 2.01 km ) long , with a drop of some 50 feet ( 15 m ) through the limestone strata . The natural lake and waterfall were covered when the Colorado River was dammed with the completion of Max Starcke Dam in 1951 . A photo of the falls as they once existed can be seen at the website for the Wallace Guest House , a local bed and breakfast . Lake Marble Falls sits between Lake Lyndon B. Johnson to the north and Lake Travis to the south . The falls for which the city is named are now underwater but are revealed every few years when the lake is lowered .

In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , with Death - Eaters in charge of the school , the subject is renamed the Dark Arts , and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse on those who have earned detentions . The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members -- throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year . Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject . During the period the story takes place , the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell ( book one ) , Gilderoy Lockhart ( book two ) , Remus Lupin ( book three ) , Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor `` Mad - eye '' Moody ( book four ) , Dolores Umbridge ( book five ) , Severus Snape ( book six ) , and Amycus Carrow ( book seven ) . Hagrid suggests in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that `` They 're startin ' ter think the job 's jinxed . No one 's lasted long for a while now . '' In Half - Blood Prince , Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected . The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling . The position had also been coveted by Snape , but he was denied the position as well . Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half - Blood Prince . Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died , the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue , set nineteen years afterwards . Furthermore , she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject .
